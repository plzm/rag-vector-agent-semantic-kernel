## Learning objetives
* Undetstand how Semantic Kernel `AgentGroupChat` works
* Use **Agent Group Chat** to coordinate collboration between AI agents
* Use Agent instructions to define AI agent's roles and  responsabilities

## Create Agents that participate in the Group Chat
1. Task: Create a new file call AgentGroupChat.cs
    
    Add this starting code

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
    using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Agents;
    using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Agents.Chat;
    using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.ChatCompletion;

    namespace AgentsSample;

    public static class TravelAgentChatCoordinator
    {
    }       
    ```

2. Task: Create a method to create basic agents named **CreateBasicAgent**

    `CreateBasicAgent` is a agent builder (without skills) to simplify the creation of multiples agents.

    Add this mehod to `TravelAgentChatCoordinator` class.
    ```csharp
        /// <summary>
        ///  Create a basic agent with the given name, kernel, and instructions.
        ///  This agent has not skills, and it is used to create a chat completion agent.
        /// </summary>
        private static ChatCompletionAgent CreateBasicAgent (string agentName, Kernel agentKernel, string agentInstructions, string agentDescription)
        {
            return new ChatCompletionAgent()
            {
                // Define what and how the agent should respond.
                Instructions = agentInstructions,
                // Define the agent name.
                Name = agentName,
                // Define the kernel that the agent will use to generate responses.
                Kernel = agentKernel,
                // Define the agent description. This is used to describe the agent's role in the chat.
                Description = agentDescription
            };
        }
    ```

4. Task: Get the user trip request to be used in the chat.

    The `GetUserTripRequest` method is a utility method to select between multiples travels user option.

    This method provide a trip description to be use as a request (challenge)  to the Ai agent group chat.
    
    Add this mehod to `TravelAgentChatCoordinator` class.

    ```csharp
        /// <summary>
        /// Get the user trip request to be used in the chat.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns></returns>
        private static string GetUserTripRequest()
        {
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Select your trip destination:");
            Console.WriteLine("1. Paris");
            Console.WriteLine("2. Santiago");
            Console.WriteLine("3. London");
            Console.WriteLine("4. Japan");
            Console.Write("Enter your choice (1-4): ");

            string choice = Console.ReadLine() ?? string.Empty;
            return choice switch
            {
                "1" => """

                    The journey includes a stay in a charming Parisian hotel with an Eiffel Tower view and breakfast included, from December 25th to December 30th, accommodating two guests. 
                    My flight, preferably with Delta Airlines, will depart from Boston on December 25th and return on December 30th.

                """
            };
        }
    ```

5. Task: Create a new class `ApprovalTerminationStrategy`to review the termination condition based on **Termination key** has been expresed by the agent

    The `ApprovalTerminationStrategy` class in a Semantic Kernel agent is designed to implement a specific strategy for terminating a process based on approval criteria.

    In this case, the chat discussion going to end when the specific `terminationKey` is mentioned by the AI agent.

    This class is a member of ``class TravelAgentChatHelper`` so should be added in the TravelAgentChatHelper class.
    ```csharp
        /// <summary>
        /// Check if the final message contains the termination key to determine if the chat should end.
        /// </summary>
        private sealed class ApprovalTerminationStrategy(string terminationKey) : TerminationStrategy
        {
            // Terminate when the final message contains the term including the termination key.
            protected override Task<bool> ShouldAgentTerminateAsync(Agent agent, IReadOnlyList<ChatMessageContent> history, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
                => Task.FromResult(history[history.Count - 1].Content?.Contains(terminationKey, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ?? false);
        }
    ```
6. Task: Add the method `TravelAgentGroupChatSecuential`

    this method create:
    * ** 4 Agents**: Each agent has different role and responsability
    
        TravelAgencyAgent: request, evaluate and select the travel  options provided by the other agentes.
        
        BookingAgent: This agent only can book flights and hotels when it is commaned to do it.

        HotelSearchAgent: This agent only could search for hotel options.
        
        FlightSearchAgent: this agent only can search for fly options.

    * **AgentGroupChat**: created as sequencial chat defined by the order on how the agent was created.
    The code `ApprovalTerminationStrategy(terminationKey)` in a Semantic Kernel agent creates an instance of the ApprovalTerminationStrategy class, which defines a specific termination strategy based on a given key. This approach ensures that the agent's process only terminates when the specified approval condition is met, making the termination logic modular and adaptable.

    * **UserInput** is the user's trip request (challenge to solve) 
    
    * **chat.InvokeAsync()** Trigger the Chat discussion where the agents iterate to solve the problem. 


    Add this method in the class `TravelAgentChatHelper`.
    ```csharp
    /// <summary>
        /// Create and Agent Chat Group  to solve the travel booking  problem propoused by the user in the chat.
        /// </summary>

    ## Assistant - TravelAgencyAgent ##
    After reviewing the options, here are my recommendations based on your preferences:

    **Flight Selection:**
    - **LATAM Airlines Flight 815** seems to be the best option for you. It departs at a convenient time in the morning and arrives early enough the next day for you to start your exploration of Santiago. The return flight also allows you to have a full day in Santiago on January 15th before heading to the airport for your flight back to Boston. Additionally, this option is the most cost-effective, at $875 per person for the round trip.

    **Hotel Selection:**
    - **Mandarin Oriental, Santiago** is my recommended choice. It offers stunning views of the Andes, which aligns with your desire for a mountain view, and includes breakfast. The elegant setting and renowned spa create a luxurious experience consistent with your request, all at a slightly more affordable rate of $360 per night compared to some other options.

    These selections provide a balance of luxurious amenities, scenic views, and optimal scheduling for your travel days, all while being mindful of cost.

    approve and ready to book
